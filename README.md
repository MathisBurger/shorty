# Shorty

In the following I will talk about my experience with elixir and svelte.

## Project
I decided to learn elixir and svelte, because I wanted to learn something new.
I started building and url shorting service. It is not a really complex project and
with another language, this could be an one day project.
But because my goal was to learn some new languages and frameworks, this seems like
the right project for me.

## Elixir
At the early beginning elixir was kinda fun to learn, because it has some programming concepts,
I have never heard of. But after a few hours into elixir, it roasted my head completely and I wanted
to stop working with it. There were random errors although I did not changed anything.
I am aware of some type errors and I checked, if these errors. But this would be a too easy fix.
After a few more hours, I figured out how to work with elixir and finished it as far as it was usable
with postman. But unfortunately I did not implemented CORS yet. After I started using a plug named "cors_plug"
my brain was fucked completely. It did not worked at all. I tried for hours to figure out, how this plug 
works, but I did not found a solution. Furthermore the elixir community is not as big as other communities.
Therefore there are less examples and threads you can use.

## Svelte
I heared of svelte before and I was fascinated by the idea of replacing a virtual DOM with a compiler.
I started using svelte and fell in love with it. It is very easy to use and has some great features, that
are missing in more popular frameworks like react. I like the way svelte works and how it makes 
it easier to develop fast, innovative webapps.

## Conclusion
I do not recommend learning elixir, because it is a complete waste of time. You do not 
have any advantages in comparison to other languages like python, golang or rust. 
Svelte instead is a great framework to learn. I had very much fun working with it and its concepts.
It is innovative and super fast. I definitely recommend learning it. 

## State of the project
This project is not finished. I do not think I will finish it in the future. My goal was not to build 
a fully functional webapp, but instead I wanted to learn something new about elixir and svelte.
